				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Resist! Do touch the BB-8 Display! Unfortuantely Target will be tearing down and destroying these awesome displays. Wouldn't it be awesome if they did a contest or something to give them away?</p>

				<p>This page was inspired by all the BB-8 selfies on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/everythingbb8/" target="_blank">Everything BB-8 Facebook Group</a>. I thought it would be fun to match them up with the Target stores they were taken at and see how far the Resistance has spread.</p>

				<h3>Technical Stuff</h3>
				<p>This site was also an excuse to play around with Aurelia, a JavaScript framework, C# WebAPI 2 backend, and Azure. The JavaScript site is open source on <a href="https://github.com/dankraus/bb8resistance-aurelia" target="_blank">GitHub @ BB-8 Resistance Client</a>. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/dankraus/target-store-scraper-socrata-pusher" target="_blank">Target store scraper</a> scheduled job that pulls Target stores from their website and process sends the data to the Socrata Open Data service.</p>
