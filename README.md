# The BB-8 Resistance (Client)


[thebb8resistance.com](http://thebb8resistance.com)

Upload your photo touching the Star Wars BB-8 Target Store display. Defy the 'Do Not Touch' sticker and join the resistance! Unfortuantely Target plans to destore all the store displays. See and touch before they're gone!

This app is my first go with working with [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/). It's based on the [Aurelia Skeleton Nav App](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation).

**Note:** I've taken down the site for now. The BB-8's were taken down at Target and most met their demise in trash compactors. I decided to cut some server costs down.

## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
  > **Note:** Gulp must be installed globally, but a local version will also be installed to ensure a compatible version is used for the project.
4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```
  > **Note:** jspm must be installed globally, but a local version will also be installed to ensure a compatible version is used for the project.

  > **Note:** jspm queries GitHub to install semver packages, but GitHub has a rate limit on anonymous API requests. It is advised that you configure jspm with your GitHub credentials in order to avoid problems. You can do this by executing `jspm registry config github` and following the prompts. If you choose to authorize jspm by an access token instead of giving your password (see GitHub `Settings > Personal Access Tokens`), `public_repo` access for the token is required.
5. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:

  ```shell
  jspm install -y
  ```
  >**Note:** Windows users, if you experience an error of "unknown command unzip" you can solve this problem by doing `npm install -g unzip` and then re-running `jspm install`.
6. To run the app, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  gulp watch
  ```
7. Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under `src` and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.

> The Skeleton App uses [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for automated page refreshes on code/markup changes concurrently across multiple browsers. If you prefer to disable the mirroring feature set the [ghostMode option](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-ghostMode) to false

```

## Bundling
Bundling is performed by [Aurelia Bundler](http://github.com/aurelia/bundler). A gulp task is already configured for that. Use the following command to bundle the app:

  ```shell
    gulp bundle
  ```

You can also unbundle using the command bellow:

  ```shell
  gulp unbundle
  ```
#### Configuration
The configuration is done by ```bundles.json``` file.
##### Optional
Under ```options``` of ```dist/aurelia``` add ```rev: true``` to add bundle file revision/version.

## Exporting bundled production version
A gulp task is already configured for that. Use the following command to export the app:

  ```shell
    gulp export
  ```
The app will be exported into ```export``` directory preserving the directory structure.
#### Configuration
The configuration is done by ```bundles.json``` file.
In addition, ```export.json``` file is available for including individual files.
